	"LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_13": "The trade route through the Deadlands has been cut off. Caravans are being bombarded by ballistas. A dreadful fire has sparked up in the woods surrounding the route. Will you be overcome these obstacles?",
	"LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_14": "An Emissary of Darkness has been spotted on the route to the Gravehall Estate, the one that leads along the edge of the bottomless chasm.

	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_160": "Even Gunar has left the ancient abode to escape the monsters that have settled there. Shavarakk's servants are merciless!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_161": "The times are changing, new heroes and villains are being born. Only the beauty of this crystal wonder remains eternal.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_162": "If you look deep into the ice, you can see giants frozen forever at the bottom.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_163": "The rulers of the icy wasteland have no feelings. Remember this when treading on the smooth ice of Glass Lake.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_164": "Aggressive snow golems live among the white needles piercing the cold sky. Be careful!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_165": "Somebody said there's a treasure at the end of the labyrinth. Some lost souls are still looking for it there.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_166": "Carved into ancient stones, the old runes have long since been covered by new symbols. The energy they radiate is filled with anger and hatred!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_167": "Blocks of ice crackle and fall into the dark abyss. Keep looking ahead unless you want to follow them!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_168": "Blue flame burns as hot as lava, searing skin with strange and agonizing marks.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_169": "A sacred place, now home to dark mages. This is where the captured scholar Cornelius was kept.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_17": "The defiled statue of the king is looking at his subjects with sadness. The age of centaurs is coming to an end.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_170": "An incredibly strong energy source. Its conversion to serve the Darkness was a harsh blow to the Dominion.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_171": "Seized by the enemy, the watchtowers give the demons an advantage. But for how long?",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_172": "The local airstreams are so cold, they're almost as dangerous as the Archdemon's agents.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_173": "Let the memories of the brave deeds celebrated by great poets echo on. Keep moving, towards new adventures!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_174": "There's nobody to keep the fire burning. The strong went to war, the rest chose to side with the enemy. ",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_175": "The Jarl's heir is too young to take vengeance on the dark emissary that killed his father. But the time for vengeance will come!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_176": "Many experienced walkers are buried under the thick snow. Forever young in this endless winter...",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_177": "Under the weathered, sharp black cliffs, in the depths of the central rock, reside the Wargs. ",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_178": "Every step on this rocky infertile soil sings out a hollow resonance. And so, naturally, the enemy knows your every move.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_179": "Razor-sharp spears will effectively convey how happy the locals are to see you.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_18": "The only place to cross is blocked by a gang of bandits. The way must be cleared at all costs.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_180": "This poor thing was here long before the war with the Arhidemon. Fighting for land and resources never gets old!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_181": "Smoke and ashes, noise and clatter are common in this mining town. Even the war hasn't changed it.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_182": "You squelch through the mud, every step harder than the last. But this place is too dangerous to stop here.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_183": "This place looks like it was made for an ambush. A twig cracked in the grove on the right. Or was it your imagination?",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_184": "It's getting hot. Surely you'll soon see the famous valley of geysers.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_185": "Hot springs coming out from the tops of mossy hills, a true wonder! This smell, though...",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_186": "The stench of brimstone is too obnoxious, making it hard to breathe. Add a bit of fire, and you'd be in Hell.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_187": "The earth here is covered with bones. You'd think it's a graveyard. But no: this is where the dark hordes feast!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_188": "The Wargs were smart not to fight the invaders. Instead, they made an agreement and share their catch.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_189": "Go, don't be afraid. The ice this bridge is made of is thousands of years old, it has outlived whole dynasties.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_19": "The waters of this river wipe away all memories. Perhaps it was used to turn the forest dwellers to the dark side?",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_190": "The realm of ice ends here. But will you get through Shavarakk's domain alive?",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_2": "Even seasoned warriors stay clear of this place. The quietness is deceptive;\n just take a careful look!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_20": "The light can´t pass through these thick branches. The shaman´s dark magic made the shadows thicker, and now the darkness under trees is pitch-black.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_21": "Marax himself touched these lands with his fiery hand, giving birth to many terrifying creatures.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_22": "How many heroes came along this road never to be seen again?",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_23": "Don´t let the dry soil and decaying stumps deceive you: great evil resides in this place, and it seeks new victims.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_24": "The evil spirits that dwell here were marked by a powerful mage. It´s sad that such talents serve the titans.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_25": "The lava fracture leads to the planet´s core, supplying the enemy legions with endless energy.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_26": "The orcish outpost emanates a horrific stench. These guys know nothing of cleanliness.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_27": "The dry bones of those who lost have been turned to dust under orcish feet. Many a squad came through here.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_28": "This huge stone stairway is a great place for an ambush. Better move along the stairs quickly.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_29": "Unending groups of guards move around. The outpost´s soldiers wouldn´t miss a chance to rob a careless traveler.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_3": "A gang of monsters is rampaging in the forest without mercy. Be careful, heroes, don´t get caught in their fiery trap!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_30": "The foulest and most cowardly monsters dwell here. Their prey is weak and wounded warriors.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_31": "Do you feel somebody watching? Look carefully into the darkness of the caves. The glittering of hundreds of eyes will be your answer!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_32": "Oh, no! The enemies want to destroy the bridge over the River of Oblivion! This can´t be allowed!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_33": "Look, a squad of orcs is carrying heavy bags full of stolen goods. They should be returned to their owners.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_34": "The forest around the funeral path to the sanctuary is filled with marauders.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_35": "If there´s anything sacred for orcs, it´s the sanctuary of the ancestors. And killing an outsider is a great way to make the forefathers happy!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_36": "The pine woods groan under the pressures of dark magic. We must remove this corruption at all costs!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_37": "These roads have been unusable ever since evil settled into the clearing.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_38": "Removing orc patrols from the path will open up the roads for trade caravans. But for how long?",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_39": "Elite squads rest here before starting new, violent, and devastating marches.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_4": "A strange place where many people disappeared. Time to find those responsible and deal with them!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_40": "Gro Bulgor is a vicious leader who pities neither his allies, nor his enemies. Do you still wish to proceed, heroes?",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_41": "If you notice a cute sheep on a pasture, remember: there´s a wolf under this clothing.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_42": "Clearings with lush grass are replaced by lifeless desert, stretching for miles in every direction.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_43": "You´re approaching the territory of cold and despair. There´s nobody alive here, but nobody dead either.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_44": "The road to Gravehall holds many dangers. Will the detour help to avoid them?",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_45": "Many gangs of highwaymen block the path to the main destination. But defeating them will be easy!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_46": "You should cross this part of the way as soon as possible to avoid the stony traps of the mountain ravine.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_47": "Be careful when breathing the local air. The power of hatred that fills it is more dangerous than smoke.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_48": "It seems that Hell itself opened its gates into this land. How many monsters will it spawn?",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_49": "If you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss gazes back into you. Go forth with courage and don´t let the evil consume you.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_5": "Wagons loaded with foreign goods are left unattended. Hurry to save their owners!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_50": "A place of silence and sorrow turned into a city of furious souls who couldn´t find peace.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_51": "Throughout the ages the number of loyal servants remains the same. Their trapped souls will never tire of serving their master.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_52": "Tread as quietly as you can, otherwise you make wake the locals from their eternal sleep.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_53": "Morana´s song echoes around Necropolis, drawing forsaken souls to fight the last battle.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_54": "An icy chill runs down your spine when you enter the Atrium. A feeling of looming danger clenches your heart.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_55": "The masters of the dead lands won´t tolerate the living in their halls! The deadly reaping has begun!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_56": "Sadly, the terraces of pure onyx now belong to the enemy.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_57": "Two sisters, Selena and Morana, hold the night´s shroud. As long as the obelisk is in one piece, the lands are ruled by darkness.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_58": "Do you see the green flicker? Here, the world of the departed merges with living matter. This is how evil enters our lands.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_59": "You can see the light at the end of the halls of the dead. But that doesn´t mean that danger is behind you.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_6": "This is the main road into the city. The bitter smell of smoke and cinder is a bad omen. Are you brave enough to enter?",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_60": "After many days of darkness the bright sun is blinding. And it makes you an easy target!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_61": "A squad of watchful centaurs is preparing something bad on the way to Cadang Thicket.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_62": "Watch your step! Nature itself has taken the enemy´s side!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_63": "Making your way through thick brush is not only exhausting, but also dangerous: it´s a good place for an ambush.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_64": "The sixth sense tells experienced warriors that this beauty is deceiving. The riverbanks are crawling with monsters.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_65": "It was here where the mad Liros, rejected by the one he loved, drowned himself in the green waters of the river.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_66": "Cadang Thicket is a home to centaurs. Their wild temper makes these creatures very unpredictable.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_67": "The fires are burning, so this place isn´t completely abandoned. Who´s there? Hello!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_68": "Don´t be deceived by the coziness of these delicate awnings and the warmth of the fires;\r\n the enemy is on their way.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_69": "The scent of the bright local trees dims the mind. Better leave this place as soon as possible.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_7": "Fire sparks are jumping along the rooftops, distracting you from the main danger ahead, at the end of the street. Be careful!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_70": "Creaking, noise, grumbling, crashing;\r\n it´s Scrump, angry at the whole world. His stocky roots are ready to grab and hold till your last breath.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_71": "Swamp miasma is very troublesome for travellers, while the local evil creatures adore this aroma.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_72": "The bog is very useful to the local monsters. They simply wait until a careless traveller steps into this dangerous sludge.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_73": "It´s the Bogger´s lair. Pray to God the master is not home.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_74": "Wet soil keeps slurping under your feet. There isn´t a living soul around. But lots of the dead!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_75": "The enchanting roots of this plant drive anyone who dares to taste them mad.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_76": "Thousands of people came to bury Lord Wreedlove, but couldn´t lay him to rest forever. He was a good person;\r\n too bad he was also a vampire.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_77": "It´s a cold and desolate place. Even the flames of torches and the glittering fireflies seem frightening and dangerous.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_78": "The road is covered with a fog so thick you can´t see the end of your nose. Try not to fall off the precipice nearby.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_79": "Another step, and you´ll enter the domain of Morth Chrone. The Reaper of Souls and his accomplices would love a fresh meal...",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_8": "The evil demons long for revenge. Their feet are pounding on the paved road, echoing terribly among stone walls.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_80": "Some people succumbed to the influence of the dark and started serving it of their own accord, losing their minds and freedom forever.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_81": "There´s only one path leading to the halls of Morth Chrone. His servants will do everything to prevent you from entering!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_82": "Vile creatures multiplied in the darkness of the night, scaring travellers and taking their souls.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_83": "Who is hiding in the shadow? Whose eyes are glowing with otherworldly fire in the dark? Be prepared, heroes, death is at your heels!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_84": "The look of this territory, covered in spiderwebs, promises trouble. Slaves of the dark won´t let outsiders reach their master.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_85": "A place where time stands still. The lair of the reaper of souls, who feasts on the misery of others. Stop Morth Chrone!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_86": "Be wary of the orcish camp ahead. You need to clear it step by step, without causing camp-wide alarm.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_87": "Orcish weapons look rough and crude but they last for years. You can seriously harm the enemy by clearing out their armory.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_88": "Break the fangs of the local monsters, punish their greediness.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_89": "Orcs light torches after every victory over the kingdom´s soldiers. Aren´t these monsters overconfident?",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_9": "Tales flew about and ale flowed like a river in Gordon´s house, until the monsters burnt it. Time to avenge the old man!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_90": "Here orcs and ogres perfect their skills. Show them what the true art of war looks like!",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_91": "This is the Arena of the Chosen. Here the strongest gladiators fight to their death.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_92": "Robbers and highwaymen, those are the current dwellers of the sacred places. These people are no better than orcs.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_93": "This gang is especially dangerous. Imperial soldiers in the past, now turned rogues.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_94": "Decrepit bridges are the only connection between human and titan lands. When they finally break, whoever is crossing will be thrown into a bottomless chasm...",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_95": "Titans and humans lived in peace until Seymour´s wicked lie cast a shadow of mistrust over their friendship.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_96": "Everybody knows this was the site of the legendary battle between titans and humans.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_97": "The war separated the peoples. Nobody knew the world would be stricken by disaster: the titans are extinct and the humans are struggling for survival.",
	"LIB_MISSION_DESC_98": "The brave warriors of Brand´s Legion once took this road. Now vultures circle above it, and hungry ghouls wait for travellers.",

The Guild Master should to assign the status of Guild Champions to the members with the most powerful teams. Only Champions can participate in a war. There can be up to 20 Champions in Golden League guilds and up to 15 in the guilds of other leagues.\r\n \r\nAfter appointing the Champions, the Guild Master has to arrange their teams across the available positions on the Guild War map. Champions can also assign their teams to defend any open position themselves.\r\n \r\nWAR\r\n \r\nGuild Wars take place from Monday to Friday. When all Leagues are full, transitional matches for the guilds which score highest or lowest in their Leagues take place on Saturday. There are no wars on Sunday. \r\n\r\nThe attacking guild's task is to score more victory points than the opposing guild. Victory points are awarded for:\r\n \r\n1) Defeating an opposing team\r\n2) Defeating all teams in a fortification (capture bonus)\r\n3) If a team position in a fortification is open (undefended), it is considered defeated and the opposing guild receives points for it.\r\n \r\nRESULTS \r\n \r\nThe end of the day marks the end of the war. The winning guild receives a reward for victory. The defeated guild receives a reward for participation. The same applies in the case of a tie. \r\n \r\nNote that the reward for the war is sent out when the next war begins.",
